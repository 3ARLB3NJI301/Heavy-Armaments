# Heavy Armaments
Like the name implies, **Heavy Armaments** is a mod that expand mindustry turret arsenals, without adding new resources or materials, so theres no need to complicate yourself

That said, without adding new materials or resource, this mod pretty much works if combined with other mods!

## Features
1. **Heavy Armamennts** features turret that expands your Mindustry arsenal to offer you more selection from entry to end-game. Each turret are unique and have it own improved version
2. All turret are researchable from the normal campaign tech-tree, most turret have their own branch so you can pretty much enjoy this mod immediately!
3. Specialization!
    - All turrets have its own improved version, not just improved, each improved version have its own specialization, like a real tech-tree system! (well this is a planned feature, already done on the Trenchgrade)
4. Not complicated!
    - Most other mod are more feature-packed, unfortunately it comes with the addition of new resources which might make it incompatible with other mod or ruin the vanilla taste of Mindustry.
