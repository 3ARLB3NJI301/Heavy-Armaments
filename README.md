# Heavy Armaments
Like the name implies, **Heavy Armaments** is a that mod attemps at expanding mindustry turret arsenals, without adding new resources or materials, so theres no need to complicate yourself

That said, without adding new materials or resource, this mod pretty much works if combined with other mods!

## Software Used
- **Inkscape** (For logo)
- **Visual Studio Code** (Editing JSON)
- **Piskel** (Making Sprites)
- **Mindustry** (duh)
