# Heavy Armaments
Like the name implies, **Heavy Armaments** is a mod that expand mindustry turret arsenals, without adding new resources or materials, so theres no need to complicate yourself

That said, without adding new materials or resource, this mod pretty much works if combined with other mods!

## Disclaimer
1. This is a ***Prototype*** 
- I will constantly make changes within these, so be careful with updating as it might ruin your savefiles. You can get the fully furnished mod at steam workshops.

2. Code'Gore'
- I have no background in any form of coding etc, everything you see here is self-taught. If you see something that could be better please do let me know!
- Im also working on this alone

3. Steam vs GitHub
- Steam version are generally more refined but slower to update, I just want to make sure that steam-users can experience the mod with little to no issue as they already paid the game anyway
- GitHub are as I say a ***'Prototype'*** or **beta**, there will be constant update & changes in here that might corrupt your savefiles

## Software Used
