# Heavy Armaments
Like the name implies, **Heavy Armaments** is a that mod attemps at expanding mindustry turret arsenals, without adding new resources or materials, so theres no need to complicate yourself

That said, without adding new materials or resource, this mod pretty much works if combined with other mods!
## Disclaimer
This is a ***Prototype*** version of **Heavy Armaments**, I will constantly make changes within these, so be careful with updating as it might ruin your savefiles
You can get the fully refurbished mod at steam workshops
