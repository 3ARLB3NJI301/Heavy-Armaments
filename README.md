# Heavy Armaments
Like the name implies, **Heavy Armaments** is a mod that expand mindustry turret arsenals, without adding new resources or materials, so theres no need to complicate yourself

That said, without adding new materials or resource, this mod pretty much works if combined with other mods!

## Features
1. **Heavy Armamennts** features turret that expands your Mindustry arsenal to offer you more selection from entry to end-game. Each turret are unique and have it own improved version
2. All turret are researchable from the normal campaign tech-tree, most turret have their own branch so you can pretty much enjoy this mod immediately!
3. Specialization!
    - All turrets have its own improved version, not just improved, each improved version have its own specialization, like a real tech-tree system! (well this is a planned feature, already done on the Trenchgrade)
4. Not complicated!
    - Most other mod are more feature-packed, unfortunately it comes with the addition of new resources which might make it incompatible with other mod or ruin the vanilla taste of Mindustry.

1. This is a ***Prototype*** 
- I will constantly make changes within these, so be careful with updating as it might ruin your savefiles. You can get the fully furnished mod at steam workshops.

- Im also working on this alone

3. Steam vs GitHub
- Steam version are generally more refined but slower to update, I just want to make sure that steam-users can experience the mod with little to no issue as they already paid the game anyway
- GitHub are as I say a ***'Prototype'*** or **beta**, there will be constant update & changes in here that might corrupt your savefiles
